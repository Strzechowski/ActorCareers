Beta version of ActorCareers.

Be patient after clicking on a link, because heroku needs a moment to get application running.

The app is not fully finished, but I want to focus on different projects now. It was nice experience to play a bit with Django framework and to create my first web application. Maybe in the future I will come back to the framework.

--------------

Application is an announcement board for actors, who are looking for the job and for companies who are looking for actors.

As an actor it gives you opportunity to:
- find a job offer for yourself
- create your own profile, if you are looking for a job

As a company linked with actors it gives you opportunity to:
- create page of your company
- post job offers for actors
- find actor you want to hire
